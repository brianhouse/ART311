# Situating ourselves via mapping

Questions asked (and notes taken) in our first class:
- Who are the teachers in your life that have had an impact?
- What are some opportunities you’ve had that have helped you get to where you are?
- What are some obstacles or challenges that have affected where you are today?
- What value or belief systems have shaped you?
- What goals or aspirations have you had that have shaped you?
- What institutions have shaped you?
- Where do you come from?
- What inspires you?

Take the list you made in class and do some reorganization. Take a close look at it—are there things that are related or interconnected across the questions? Are there other similar questions you think we should have asked but didn’t? Turn this list we made into a diagram or mind-map. Take what you wrote down (and add more to it) and find connecting threads (for example, some connecting threads could be time, place, feelings, intent, impact, technology, ideology, and so on). As you go about making your map, develop some organizing principles for it. Lay it all out on a sheet of paper that you will present next class.
