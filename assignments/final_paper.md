# Final paper

With the final paper, you will investigate what you want art to be and/or do. It will require you to articulate your perspective on art and to research connected issues and concerns. You will be asked to present a thoughtful examination of your beliefs and the conversations within the discipline that could be considered related, including other historical and contemporary artists, readings, and discussions.

Your paper should delve more deeply into some of the topics touched upon in the class over the course of the semester. It can draw from your reflection essays, and it should reflect a clear synthesis of topics covered, properly citing texts read in the course along with additional research. Clarity, organization, depth, and grasp of course material will be among the evaluating criteria for your final paper.

A one-page prospectus and short bibliography for your final paper will be due in advance, and there will be an individual meeting to discuss your ideas. The final papers should be 2000-2500 words.
