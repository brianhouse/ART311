# Influence map

Your influence map builds upon the mind-mapping exercise that we did at the beginning of the semester. This expands to include a constellation of influences that you find critical to your practice—whether ideas, particular readings, artists (whether historical, contemporary, or your peers), or even particular artworks that you've gathered (those that we've discussed in class may be among them). These influences might not only be resonant ones, but oppositional—what are you pushing against, moving toward, wrestling with, or leaving behind?

Your map should represent and/or interpret the interrelations among your influences in some way. This should move beyond a simple diagram like the introductory exercise to become an artwork in its own right. You may use any medium, whether 2D, 3D, or time-based.
