# Introducing a text

Once over the course of the semester, you will be responsible for introducing one of the assigned readings to the class. This does not mean that you have to have a definitive interpretation of the textâ€”rather, you will supply context to the reading that may or may not be fully explained in the text itself. Consider this to be a mapping exercise similar to our initial assignment, whether or not you choose to make a visual diagram.

How your introduction is organized is up to you, but it should be presented via Google slides and include the following (as applicable):

- The author
    - Basic biographical details
    - What they are known for
    - The ideas, movements, scenes, or institutions with which they are associated

- The thesis and themes of the text
    - How would you state the thesis of the text in one sentence? (This could be a quote if it is supplied)
    - In the form of a list of words, what are the general themes?

- Artists and artworks
    - If there is an artist mentioned, answer the same questions as for the author above
    - Provide images from these artists, and any specific artworks mentioned in the text

- Cultural references
    - What people, places, things, events, or other historical context comes up in the text? Make a glossary of these terms and supply a sentence or two definition
