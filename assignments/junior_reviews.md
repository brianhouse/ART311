# Junior Reviews

A faculty review of work by declared junior art majors is part of the requirements of the major. It allows faculty to guide students in their thesis work at an earlier point and open up more cross-disciplinary exchange among faculty and students. For Junior Review, students will select five pieces of their “best undergraduate work” for critique by two faculty members who will meet with the student and discuss what will be expected in subsequent reviews. Faculty will assess the work on its technical merits, formal skills, process, and content. A written reflection or statement about these works is required as part of the review.

Frequently asked questions pertaining to the Junior Review:
- _What criteria should I use in the selection of work?_  
Think about works that successfully integrated content and form. Projects that show idea development and/or personal interpretation/research, are best suited for this review.

- _I do not have one of the works I want to include. Is documentation of an art work allowed?_
Yes, a large photograph is allowed (minimum 11”x14”) but we do need to see two physical objects If displaying a photograph of a sculptural work please display various views of the subject.

- _Is ____ technology allowed?_
Yes, but it will be your responsibility to manage any supporting equipment.

- _What should I think about for the written reflection and how long should it be?_
Your statement should be max 400 words. In your statement, comment on and analyze why you think the selected works are successful. Do you see any connections across your works? Do you know what you hope your chosen artworks might communicate or make us feel? What inspires you?
