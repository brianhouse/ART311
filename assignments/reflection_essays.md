# Weekly reflection essays

Each week, you will have read a text, generated some initial questions about it, situated it in its discourse, and engaged with it in discussion. You will have most likely done this with a second text as well, and these will sit together alongside an artist talk by a visitor that may or may not touch directly on related themes.

With your reflection essays, you will have the opportunity to explore in greater depth ideas, questions, and critiques arising through this process. These will take the form of a short essay in which you may:
- plumb an as yet unresolved question
- explain how an idea resonates with your own practice (past or future!)
- offer a critique of one or more of the texts or artworks
- bring in another relevant artwork, writing, or cultural phenomenon to demonstrate a theme
- etc...

Keep your essays focused on one or two points and lead with a clear thesis in the first paragraph. They should be 300â€“400 words long, and are due on the Thursday following each class, starting with Week 3.
