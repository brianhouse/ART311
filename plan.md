## todo
- know how to manage break-out groups for discussion


## todo weekly
- grade introductions, hosting, essays
- reach out to visitors
- post:
Once things are working and I like the assignment, can build it out:
- duplicate weekly essay assignment; scheduled to appear at 6:30 that week, due the thursday after
- readings due at 3:30, appear at 6:30 the week before

## class format
- students all read a text and leave (private, apparently) comments on the assignment
- student gives intro to a text [in slides; I give them prep material]
- breakouts to discuss the questions they came with
- come together to discuss again
- they go write stuff, due by thursday

this is going to be an hour long, that's it. right? 3:30 - 4:30
