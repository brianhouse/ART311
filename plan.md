## todo

- confirm all visitors and tell the department (Ellie (havent emailed), Elisa, Nandita)
- know how to manage break-out groups for discussion
- first class prep (see below)


## todo weekly
- grade introductions, hosting, essays
- reach out to visitors
- post:
Once things are working and I like the assignment, can build it out:
- duplicate weekly essay assignment; scheduled to appear at 6:30 that week, due the thursday after
- readings due at 3:30, appear at 6:30 the week before

## class format
- students all read a text and leave (private, apparently) comments on the assignment
- student gives intro to a text [in slides; I give them prep material]
- breakouts to discuss the questions they came with
- come together to discuss again
- class proposes writing prompts
- they go write stuff, due by thursday


this is going to be an hour long, that's it. right? 3:30 - 4:30


## Intro class

what this is not, is a lecture
I will provide guidance
I havent read all these texts; we'll read this together

how do you engage with discourse as an artist?

discussion of canons
the inclusion can be challenged

you will do the work
purpose is to develop a dialogue as a cohort

--> situating exercise
