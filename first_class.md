# Intro class

## Introductions

- Hi everyone! Ok, well, it's great to meet you all.
- I realize of course that everyone's names are up on the Zoom window here, but nonetheless I think it would be nice to hear everyone's voices. Can we go around?
 -- Let's do name + pronouns
 -- a sentence or two about the medium you use and the kind of work that you do
 -- how about a favorite artist?

--> That's a lot of pressure right off the bat, I know. It doesn't have to be your favorite, it can just be an artist you're thinking of.


Alright, so I'll start. I'm Brian
I primarily work with Sound in my practice, and recently I've been working on building really big microphones to listen to very small sounds.

One of my favorite artists is Francis Alÿs, particularly his old work, like when he pushed a block of ice through the streets of Mexico City until it melted.


## Overview

This is not a lecture class, and it's certainly not about any specialized knowledge that I possess

In fact, I am anticipating that my role in this course is more or less as facilitator

The purpose is for you to develop a discourse as a cohort of artists, and to position your own art practices in relation to historical and contemporary ideas about art

It will largely be about reading and writing, which, as it turns out, are critical skills for artists in addition to whatever mediums you engage with in your studio practices

And it will be a significant amount of work in this class.

So I'll provide the structure, you will do the work, and we'll see where that takes us.


## Structure

What is that structure? So there's a couple of components to this class.

Seminar
- The first is that every week we'll have a couple readings and then a discussion
- Everyone will read every reading, and when you do, you'll generate a question or two for that discussion
- In addition, once a semester, you will introduce one of the texts to kick off discussion. We'll usually have two texts per class session, so two of you will present
- Then, after discussion, you'll write a short reflection essay. The intent there is to synthesize what you've learned and relate it to your own process.

Visiting artists
- The second component is that we will be hosting a series of visiting artists
- I'm pretty excited about this, because we have artists joining us from around the world. They'll give artists talks about their work, which gives you a chance to see some of the many directions art practice can take
- Each one of you will either introduce one of the artists or send them a thank you gift afterwards

Junior Reviews
- The third component of this class is your junior reviews. So, in our program, a faculty review of work by declared junior art majors is part of the requirements of the major. For Junior Review, you'll select some of your best work to have a crit with two faculty members. Ideally, that work foreshadows your thesis work. You'll need a statement to go with it.



One more part to this class. Today we're going to begin a short exercise that begins to situate ourselves. Over the course of the semester, that will evolve into a map of your influences, which you will represent in some way. More on that later.


Questions?

Let's take a look at this online. I'd like everyone to bring up the Google Classroom website for the course.

Who has experience with Google Classroom? Has it been used at LC?

Stream:
I'm going to be doing all communication through this stream. So it will all be in one place. I _think_ you'll get an email when I post, but I don't know for certain, so let's confirm that.

Classwork:
This will be where all the assignments are posted. For the readings, the essays, and the other assignments, the instructions will be embedded here as well.

Syllabus:
Click on it now, and we'll go over it



Now, where exactly do the texts we're reading come from in this class? They are, more or less, works of art criticism, so they are reflective about the practice of art, as opposed to being pure theory or philosophy or what have you.

There's no acceptable canon when it comes to artwork, and likewise there's no definite set of art criticism—I've come up with this collection in the hope that it will be compelling, but it's necessarily imperfect.

Some of these I know very well, and some of them I have never read. I'm not asking you to accept these ideas, in some cases they may be problematic, and they are certainly contestable. But they've all played some significant role for artists in the past, so we'll use them to develop our ideas.




Things you have to sign up for, first come first served:
- hosting
- introducing a text


## Exercise

Ok. So in the remainder of today, I want to do an exercise. And that is to begin to situate ourselves, as humans, as artists.

There's an assignment on Google Classroom called "situating ourselves"—let's all pull that up now.

You should see a list of questions. We're going to break into small groups, and I want everyone to go question by question and have each person in the group answer the question before moving to the next. This is meant to be reflective, but it isn't meant to be ponderous, just get things flowing.

We'll do this for 15 minutes or so. This will also be an attempt at using breakout rooms, so let's see how this goes.

(4 rooms of 3)

//

ok, how'd that go? so at the very least, I hope that has started you thinking. in the time before next class, I want you go go back and more thoroughly write out lists for each question—the more the better.

You're then going to think about how all the items on all the lists relate to one another. What the connecting threads or ideas are. All of that you're going to turn into a mind-map or diagram.

What is a mind-map or diagram? I don't know, I want you to figure out a way to represent it. You don't need to get carried away, and this is not about craft, so don't stress out.

But let's start to see the landscape of influences on you as an artist.



## Recap

Next week is labor day, so no classes. Which means the next time we'll see each other is 9/14.
- Complete this situating assignment
- Read the texts for that day
- Sign up for hosting an artist and introducing a text





###

it’s about understanding how your work is embedded. _everything_ has to do with racism, with the environment, with politics. You don’t need to take those things on explicitly if that’s not what you do. but you do have to understand how what you do is situated.
