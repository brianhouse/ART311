# Intro class

## Introductions

Hi everyone! Ok, well, it's great to meet you all. I realize of course that everyone's names are up on the Zoom window here, but nonetheless I think it would be great to hear everyone's voices.


## Overview

This is not a lecture class, and it's certainly not about any specialized knowledge that I possess

In fact, I am anticipating that my role in this course is more or less as facilitator

The purpose is for you to develop a discourse as a cohort of artists, and to position your own art practices in relation to historical and contemporary ideas about art

It will be about language and writing, which, as it turns out, are critical skills for artists in addition to whatever mediums you engage with in your studio practices

So I'll provide the structure, you will do the work, and we'll see where that takes us.


## Structure

What is that structure? So there's a couple of components to this class.

Seminar
- The first is that every week we'll have a couple readings and then a discussion
- Everyone will read every reading, and when you do, you'll generate a question or two for that discussion
- In addition, once a semester, you will introduce one of the texts to kick off discussion. We'll usually have two texts per class session, so two of you will present
- Then, after discussion, you'll write a short reflection essay. The intent there is to synthesize what you've learned and relate it to your own process.
- At the end of the semester you'll write a longer paper that delves into some specific aspect of art and criticism that you'd like to explore.

Visiting artists
- The second component is that we will be hosting a series of visiting artists
- I'm pretty excited about this, because we have artists joining us from around the world. They'll give artists talks about their work, which gives you a chance to see some of the many directions art practice can take
- Each one of you will either introduce one of the artists or send them a thank you gift afterwards

One more part to this class. Today we're going to begin a short exercise that begins to situate ourselves. Over the course of the semester, that will evolve into a map of your influences, which you will represent in some way. More on that later.


Questions?

Let's take a look at this online. I'd like everyone to bring up the Google Classroom website for the course.

Who has experience with Google Classroom? Has it been used at LC?

Stream:
I'm going to be doing all communication through this stream. So it will all be in one place. I _think_ you'll get an email when I post, but I don't know for certain, so let's confirm that.

Classwork:
This will be where all the assignments are posted. For the readings, the essays, and the other assignments, the instructions will be embedded here as well.

Syllabus:

Things you have to sign up for, first come first served:
- hosting
- introducing a text





###

it’s about understanding how your work is embedded. _everything_ has to do with racism, with the environment, with politics. You don’t need to take those things on explicitly if that’s not what you do. but you do have to understand how what you do is situated.
