## Course Description
This course explores enduring issues in contemporary art relevant to developing artists. Through theoretical, historical, and contemporary texts as well as the study of a variety of contemporary artists' practices, we will examine what is at stake in artmaking. Critical issues considered will include modes of production and questions of power as well as a reckoning with materials, content, and context.

The Studio Seminar On Contemporary Art Theory and Practice is an advanced level course that is reading and writing intensive. Students will build a foundation of theory to complement their visual vocabulary and will situate their own beliefs about art in a historical and contemporary context.


#### Objectives:
- Learn how to read, discuss, disagree, and contribute to a conversation about contemporary art
- Develop critical and analytical thinking about art practices in verbal, written, and creative form
- Become familiar with practical and theoretical considerations artists have faced in the past and face today
- Acquire awareness of the numerous social, political and economic structures at play in the reception and production of artwork
- Write a critical research paper that situates your beliefs in a broader art discourse


## Course Structure and Assignments

### Reading
Every week there will be assigned texts which are to be read in preparation for the class in which they are listed (these will be available on Google Classroom). In the manner of a graduate seminar, one student will introduce a text in detail, but every student will prepare questions that they have about the text in advance of class discussion. Your must thoughtfully participate in every class, as this is your opportunity to propose, debate, and refine a perspective on what art does in the world together with a community of your peers.

### Writing
Each student will more carefully consider issues raised in discussion through weekly reflections. This will take the form of a short 300–400 word essay. This is a way for you to synthesize what we are learning in class and to situate your own art practice.

### Visiting Artists
In addition, we will have seven visiting artists this semester meeting with us to talk about their work. Everyone in the class will have a task hosting one of the visiting artists (an introduction, gift, or thank you). In addition, you are expected to incorporate research and reflection related to each of the visiting artist lectures into our class discussions and your writing.

### Final Paper
With the final paper, you will investigate what you want art to be and/or do. It should reflect a clear synthesis of topics covered throughout the semester, properly citing texts read in the course along with additional texts and other research. Clarity, organization, depth, and grasp of course material will be among the evaluating criteria for your final paper. The text should be 2000-2500 words, and a one-page prospectus and short bibliography for your final paper will be due in advance.

### Influence Map
Over the course of the semester, you will create and refine an image (or other representation) that locates your practice within a web of disciplines, discourses, and artists that influence and inform your work.

## COVID-19 Alterations
In order to maintain consistency throughout the semester, incorporate artist visits via Zoom, and accommodate immunocompromised members of the community, this course will be entirely online for Fall 2020. Online discussion will be one hour followed by artist visits and/or time for written work and individual meetings. The course will be managed through Google Classroom.


## Policies

### Values
It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life experiences may be a common benefit. Content in this studio art course may at times challenge our aethestic and/or ethical values; free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected, but harassment and disrespect will not be tolerated. During class discussion and critique we aim to be mindful and generous in our interactions and to make everyone feel heard.

### Dynamic Syllabus
This is a new course, and as such is highly subject to change. The due dates and requirements posted on Google Classroom will be the definitive versions. It is your responsibility to consult it and stay up-to-date.

### Accommodations
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation  to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7192). Staff in the SSSO will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible; please also make an appointment to discuss with me personally.  

### Academic Integrity
Please refer to the policy on [Academic Integrity](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/) available on the College’s 'Policies and Procedures' webpage. Submitting work not generated for this course constitutes academic dishonesty. Copying a work or representing something already made must be done so with clear acknowledgement and deliberate consideration. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be taken very seriously. If you have any questions or are unsure, just ask.

### Land Acknowledgement
The Fields Art Center is built on land belonging to the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watalala bands of the Chinook, the Tualatin Kalapuya, and other indigenous nations of the Columbia River, and we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. Furthermore, we are at an institution named after white colonizers in a city with a racist history. As artists, we must be aware of and resist the many ways violence is perpetuated toward marginalized people.
